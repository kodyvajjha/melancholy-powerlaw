# melancholy-powerlaw

This is an attempt to check if the distribution of the frequency of words in Richard Burton's "The Anatomy of Melancholy" follows
a power law such a Zipf's law. 

All the statistics has been inspired by Clauset,Shalizi,Newman (2007). The python package 'python-powerlaw' has been used. 

In conclusion it has been noted that for the observed data, a power-law with a scaling factor of approximately 2.10 performs only
slightly better than a lognormal distribution.
